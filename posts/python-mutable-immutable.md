In Python, using `call_count = [0]` instead of `call_count = 0` in this context allows the counter to be mutable and shared across the recursive function calls. This is necessary because integers are immutable in Python, and reassigning `call_count` inside the nested function wouldn't affect the `call_count` defined outside the function. Using a list (or another mutable type) circumvents this issue.

Here's a detailed explanation:

### Immutability of Integers
If you use `call_count = 0`, any attempt to modify `call_count` inside the recursive function would only change a local copy of the variable, not the original `call_count` defined outside the function. This is due to Python's handling of variable scope and the immutability of integers.

### Mutable Types
Using a mutable type like a list allows the nested function to modify the content of the list, which reflects outside the function as well.

### Example with an Integer (Immutable Type)

```python
def minimal_difference_bruteforce(values):
    n = len(values)
    call_count = 0  # This is an integer, which is immutable

    def com(i, sum_one, sum_two):
        nonlocal call_count
        call_count += 1  # Modify the nonlocal variable
        if i == n:
            return abs(sum_one - sum_two)
        a = com(i + 1, sum_one + values[i], sum_two)
        b = com(i + 1, sum_one, sum_two + values[i])
        return min(a, b)

    min_diff = com(0, 0, 0)
    print(f"Number of recursive calls (brute-force): {call_count}")
    return min_diff

# Example usage
values = [5, 8, 13, 27, 14]
print(f"Minimal difference (brute-force): {minimal_difference_bruteforce(values)}")
```

### Example with a List (Mutable Type)

```python
def minimal_difference_bruteforce(values):
    n = len(values)
    call_count = [0]  # This is a list, which is mutable

    def com(i, sum_one, sum_two):
        call_count[0] += 1  # Modify the first element of the list
        if i == n:
            return abs(sum_one - sum_two)
        a = com(i + 1, sum_one + values[i], sum_two)
        b = com(i + 1, sum_one, sum_two + values[i])
        return min(a, b)

    min_diff = com(0, 0, 0)
    print(f"Number of recursive calls (brute-force): {call_count[0]}")
    return min_diff

# Example usage
values = [5, 8, 13, 27, 14]
print(f"Minimal difference (brute-force): {minimal_difference_bruteforce(values)}")
```

### `nonlocal` Keyword
Alternatively, you can use the `nonlocal` keyword to modify a variable from an enclosing scope within a nested function. This keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions, where the variable is not defined in the local scope but in the enclosing scope.

### Summary
- **Immutable Type (Integer)**: Reassignment in the nested function doesn't affect the outer variable.
- **Mutable Type (List)**: Changes to the content of the list in the nested function are reflected outside the function.
- **`nonlocal` Keyword**: Allows modifying a variable from an enclosing scope inside a nested function.
