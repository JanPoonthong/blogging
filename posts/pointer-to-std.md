Certainly! Let's break down the line `FILE *output_stream = stdout;` step by step:

1. `FILE *`: This is the data type declaration. It specifies that `output_stream` is a pointer to a `FILE` object. In C, when you want to work with streams using functions from the standard library, you use pointers to `FILE` objects.

2. `output_stream`: This is the variable name. It's the name you're giving to the pointer that will hold the address of a `FILE` object.

3. `= stdout;`: This part of the line initializes the `output_stream` pointer with the address of the `stdout` stream object. Here's what's happening:

   - `stdout` is a predefined global variable of type `FILE *`. It represents the standard output stream, which is typically used for printing text to the console.

   - When you write `stdout` in this context, you're referring to the memory address where the `stdout` stream object is stored.

   - By assigning `stdout` to the `output_stream` pointer, you're making `output_stream` point to the same memory location as `stdout`. In other words, `output_stream` now points to the standard output stream.

So, the line `FILE *output_stream = stdout;` declares a pointer to a `FILE` object named `output_stream`, and it initializes this pointer to point to the standard output stream (`stdout`). This allows you to use the `output_stream` pointer to interact with the standard output stream using functions like `fprintf`.
